# ðŸš— Self-Driving Car

This is a browser-based **self-driving car simulation** built with **JavaScript**.  
It uses a **feed-forward neural network** and **genetic mutation** to train cars to drive autonomously on a road with dummy traffic.

## âœ¨ Features
- **AI Cars** that learn to drive using neural networks.
- **Sensors** detect road borders and other vehicles.
- **Traffic Cars (Dummies)** act as obstacles.
- **Training & Mutation**:
  - Best-performing AI car is saved.
  - Neural networks mutate for improvement.
- **Save & Load AI Brain**:
  - Save trained model to `localStorage`.
  - Export/Import brain as JSON file.
- **Visualizer** that shows the carâ€™s decision-making neural network in real time.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Self-Driving-Car.git
cd Self-Driving-Car
````

### 2. Open in browser

Just open `index.html` in your browser (no build tools needed).

## ðŸŽ® Controls

* **Keyboard** (for manual cars):

  * `Arrow Up` â†’ Accelerate
  * `Arrow Down` â†’ Reverse
  * `Arrow Left` â†’ Steer left
  * `Arrow Right` â†’ Steer right

* **AI Cars**: Learn automatically using sensors + neural network.

## ðŸ§  Training AI

1. Increase car population in `main.js`:

   ```js
   const cars = generateCars(1000);
   ```
2. Let cars drive â†’ best one survives.
3. Save best brain:

   ```js
   save();
   ```
4. Reload and watch improvement.

You can also **export** and **import** the brain:

* **Download** â†’ Saves `bestBrain.json`
* **Upload** â†’ Loads brain into simulation

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Used

* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â†’ Core simulation
* **Canvas API** â†’ Rendering
* **Feed-Forward Neural Network** (custom implementation)
* **Genetic Algorithm** (mutation for learning)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements

* Add traffic generation dynamically (instead of hardcoded).
* Add different road types (curves, intersections).
* Implement reward-based reinforcement learning.
